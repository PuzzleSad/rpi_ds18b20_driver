(char**)realloc( sa->strarr, sa->count * sizeof(char*) );
was previously
(char**)realloc( sa->strarr, sa->count );
        Potentially an extremely dangerous bug due to malloc allocating pages of 
        memory. The program does not yield a segfault when run due to pages allocated on new alloc.
        Caught with valgrind.
